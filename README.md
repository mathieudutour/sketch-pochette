A Sketch plugin that lets you carry your most used properties close to your mouse.

## Why this Plugin?

Every time you want to edit your elements precisely you need to travel with your mouse to the panel inspector. So to avoid this repeat movement *sketch-pochette* bring the properties close to where your mouse is. 
Thinking about Painting artists carry the brushes and colors in a pallet; as digital artists, we need our tools closly too.

Bonus point bumbags are cooler again.
